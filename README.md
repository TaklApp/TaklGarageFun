Takl Car Garage
===============

Great, we'd love to see your coding abilities and style inside this project. This is supposed to be a project so users can manage their copious number of cars. So we have some tasks for you to flesh out the project. First you should fork this repo.

Tasks
-----

* Fix the app so the tests dont fail
* Create an admin screen for Cars (Using ActiveAdmin, see app/admin/)
* Make it so a user can have many cars associated with them
* Add a year field so I can own a car from 2003

Tips
----

We like automated tests at Takl, so you should use those. There are some examples in this repo, most work fine.
Don't feel like you must obey whats already in place, if you think theres a better way, go for it.


Totally Optional Tasks
----------------------
If you've got the time try out these optional tasks, but don't neglect the main tasks for these:

* Change the DB over to Postgres
