Takl Car Garage
===============

Great, we'd love to see your coding abilities and style inside this project. This is supposed to be a project so users can manage their copious number of cars. So we have some tasks for you to flesh out the project. First you should fork this repo.

Tasks
-----

* Fix the app so the tests dont fail
* Create an admin screen for Cars
* Make it so a user can have many cars associated with them
* Add a year field so I can own a car from 2003
